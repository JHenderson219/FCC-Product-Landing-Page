        <p> 2D glasses were originally devised by Hank Green for his wife, Katherine.</p> 
        <p>Like many others, Katherine suffered from terrible headaches when viewing 3D movies.</p> 
        <p>Being a fan of going to the movies with his wife, Hank decided he needed to do something to bring this suffering to an end.</p>
        <p>Thus, the juggernaut known as 2D glasses was born.</p>
        <p> This wonder of technology was first announced in 2011 on the Youtube channel "Vlogbrothers". </p>
